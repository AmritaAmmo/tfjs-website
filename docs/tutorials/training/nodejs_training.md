# Training and Prediction in Node.js

In this tutorial you will train a model to make predictions of baseball pitch types from sensor data. The training will be done server-side in a Node.js application.

This exercise will demonstrate steps to setup the tfjs-node npm package in your server application, build a model, and train it with data downloaded from the web. It will also show how to communicate training status to a client, and use the trained model for prediction in a client/server architecture.
